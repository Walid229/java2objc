Support structs, configured via mappings.properties and maybe a compiler switch.

Detect assignment of new objects to fields (as opposed to properties), remove " autorelease]".

Move static field initialization expressions into + (void) initialize function.

Perhaps detect finalize method, merge with existing dealloc function (except for GCed Objective C, it should still be finalize).
